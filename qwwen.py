# add 3 numbers funtion # Certainly! Let's create a function that adds three numbers. Here's the complete Python code:

def add_three_numbers(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z

# Example usage
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
# return 0

# Using the function to add three numbers
result = add_three_numbers(a, b, c)
print("The sum of a, b, and c is:", result)
